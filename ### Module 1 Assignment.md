### Module 1 Analysis

## __Overview of Project__

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Louise in obtaining concise and visible trends of the data points collected for her 
kickstarter fundraising for her theater production initiative around the world. Over a span of 8 years, a wealth of information has 
been collected on the pledges received by backers in different parts of the world for production kickstarters. Using this data this analysis 
will help Louise use successful factors and conclusions drawn from the past to make for successful fundraising campaigns in the future.

After looking at the Theater Outcomes Based on Lanch Date, we can conclude that the significant peak in successful campaigns in April 
and May could be due to the end of the school year in most countries. Pledges may have more finances available and time to invest in theater
events they may want to attend. As the summer comes to an end we can see this success rate decline back to its original place. I would advise
Louise to look further into the demographics of the backers for these summertime successes. I suspect she will find that the pledgers in these
areas are either college students of parents who are seeking to find entertainment for their children during Summer break. This insight could
be helpful to Louise depending on the genre and intended audience for an event and therefore encourage interested pledgers to give. Even if
not along these lines, this time of the year is commonly known for people to have more time and more resources to utilize to their interest.

The record of no cancellations being recorded through September and October may be a sign of possible overconfidence coming out of the 
Summer time hype. Along with this data point we see a slight spike in failures. Louise should not persist through kickstarters through these months
and cancel to spend efforts to more successful causes. Throughout the holiday months of November and December, pledges may be bombarded with more
options and entertainment opportunities that causes the lowest successful campaigns for the year. Campaigns at this time of the year bring the 
success and failure rates the closest to 50%. This volatility should be a time to analyze heavily into the failures and determine what will be
the deciding factors for cancelling a kickstarter.

Lastly, coming into the New Year, Louise can expect events to take an uptick in February. If concentrated in the US, this could be due to 
Valentines Day wherever it may be celebrated. This could be a peak time in the year to appeal to couples.

What I can conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals is that Kickstarters that have goals below $10,000 display the interest and desire to invest into plays in these countries and possible economy differences. Also there is a downward trend as the goals increase. This is due to the only play kickstarters succeeding in this category being campaigns in the US. The only kickstarter outside of the US at these higher goals is one in Sweden and this begs the possibility of it being an outlier with a matching high average donation. Further analysis into the pledge amounts may find a unusually high pledge by a small amount of pledgers. As for the US kickstarters between 35k and 45k causing the spike, these titles are outliers.

The limitations of this dataset is that it does not include a sheet of the pledge amounts of each backer for a specific kickstarter and what country this amount came from. High average donations could speak to where a specific pledger may be skewing the data. It will help Louise to have a better expectation of what her attainable goals are in specific categories and countries.
Some recommended tables and graphs would be a visual chart showing the amount of backers by goals ranges. Cancellations can be timed based on what amount of backers should we expect in a period of time. Also outcomes based on popularity in staff picks and spotlight. Staff are some times the most educated on which production to provide to their area and other times the attention brought from other muses may help guide Louises attention to the correct productions.
