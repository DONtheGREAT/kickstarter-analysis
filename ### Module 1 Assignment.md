### Module 1 Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Louise in obtaining concise and visible trends of the data points collected for her 
kickstarter fundraising for her theater production initiative around the world. Over a span of 8 years, a wealth of information has 
been collected on the pledges received by backers in different parts of the world for production kickstarters. Using this data this analysis 
will help Louise use successful factors and conclusions drawn from the past to make for successful fundraising campaigns in the future.
